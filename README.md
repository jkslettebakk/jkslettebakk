- 👋 Hi, I’m @jkslettebakk (Jann Slettebakk)
- 👀 I have for years, since my first Fortran and Pasqual programs in the 1980'ies been interested in Programming but never done "programming" my bread and butter, more like a hobby. Not languages as dotnet (preferably c#), python, SQL, noSQL, graph technology (protegè etc.) has become my passion. In addition DataOps is my bread and butter in the Digital Twin aera  ...
- 🌱 I'm currently learning HAN interface and protocols (DLMS/COSEM etc.) using edge technology (Raspberry Pi/Rasbian/Ubuntu etc.) with API (in dotnet c#) with database (using CRUD) behind a IIS server ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DLMS/COSEM/OBIS protocols and codes/objects
- 📫 You may reach me.....
