- 👋 Hi, I’m @jkslettebakk (Jann Slettebakk)
- 👀 I have for years, since my first Fortran and Pasqual programs in the 1980'ies been interested in Programming but never done "programming" my bread and butter, more like a hobby. Now it is languages like dotnet (preferably c#), python, SQL, noSQL, graph technology (protegè/StarDog etc.) has become my passion. Engineering(Area and Systems)/3D/Systems/DataOps/IT and IT/IS/IM Enterprice architecture is my bread and butter where the Digital Twin becoms reality ...
- 🌱 On spare time I'm currently learning AMS/HAN interface and protocols (DLMS/COSEM etc. See https://github.com/jkslettebakk/HAN) using edge technology (like Raspberry Pi/Rasbian/Ubuntu etc.) with API (in dotnet c#) with database (using CRUD) behind an IIS server ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DLMS/COSEM/OBIS protocols and codes/objects
- 📫 You may reach me...
